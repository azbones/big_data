    "Variables in Python are names for values that are stored in memory. Typically, local variables in Python use lower case letters and underscores \"_\" to create words or statements that describe the value of the variable. More detailed style information can be found in the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) style guide. Here is a simple example of a variable called \"counter\":\n",

    "<code>counter = 2</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other languages, Python uses dynamic typing, so datatypes are inferred from the value of the variable. In the \"<code>counter</code>\" example above, Python assumes that the \"2\" is an integer or type of <code>int</code>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that <code>counter</code> is an integer is critical if you plan to do any calculations with it. For example, if you divided the value in <code>counter</code> by 4 and expect the answer to be .5, you would be mistaken. Try this in the code block below:"

    "**Basic Built-in Boolean and Sequence Datatypes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean types:\n",

    "\n",
    "The inner-workings of each of these types can become complex, but understanding the basics of accessing data is important to a data scientist and there are some common approaches regardless of type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sequence type, there are two ways to get parts of those sequences- indexing and slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a zero-based index that means the first element will be zero, the second element will be one, and so on.  To access a specific value, you append the index of that value to the sequence like:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Slicing**\n",

    "Variables in Python are names for values that are stored in memory. Typically, variables in Python are lower case letters that describe the value of the variable like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>counter = 2</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other languages, Python uses dynamic typing, so datatypes are inferred from the value of the variable. In the \"<code>counter</code>\" example above, Python assumes that the \"2\" is an integer or type of <code>int</code>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that <code>counter</code> is an integer is critical if you plan to do any calulations with it. For example, if wanted to divide the value in <code>counter</code> by 2 expecting the answer to be .5, you would be mistaken. Try this in the code block below:"

    "**Some Basic Built-in Datatypes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.7.x has the following built-in numeric datatypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <code>int</code>: plain integers like 4\n",
    "* <code>float</code>: floating point numbers like 4.0\n",
    "* <code>complex</code>: complex numbers like 4j\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the datatype of any object, you can use the <code>type</code> function like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>type(object)</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many analytic tasks use numeric types, so it is good to be familar with them. Beyond numeric values, many analytic tasks will also include other built-in types like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean types:\n",
    "* <code>bool</code>: boolean like True or False\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence types:\n",
    "* <code>str</code>: string like this sequence of characters \"this is a string\"\n",
    "* <code>list</code>: list like this list of ints: [1,2,3]\n",
    "* <code>tuple</code>: tuple like this tuple of ints: (1,2,3)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about the details of types here- https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not going to go into the significantly more complex inner-workings of these types, but understanding the basics of accessing data is important to a data scientist and there are some common approaches regardless of type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sequence type, there are two ways to get parts of those sequences- indexing and slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a zero-based index which means that the first element will be zero.  To access a specific value, you append the index of that value to the sequence like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>my_sequence[0] # The zero in square brackets returns the first or 0th element </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Slices work by extending the idea of an index with an operator that allows you to select a range of index locations in a sequence type. Specifically, you use <code>:</code> and index locations to retrive parts of the sequence like:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "my_sequence[start:end] # items from start through end-1\n",
    "my_sequence[start:]    # items from start through the rest of the array\n",
    "my_sequence[:end]      # items from the beginning through end-1\n",
    "my_sequence[:]         # the whole array\n",

Arrays and dataframes are great not only because they can represent multidimensional data like a spreadsheet, but also because they use vectorized code. In Python this means both NumPy arrays and pandas dataframes use optimized C code that doesn't need to use Python for loops and can therefore be much more concise and much faster.\n",
    "\n",

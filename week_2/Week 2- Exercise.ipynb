Requests makes it easy to do \"web scaping\" like this. The data returned from the website is JSON, but we will reading that JSON into a pandas dataframe for analysis.\n",

Once you run the code in the cell below, the function <code>get_shot_stats</code> will be available for you to use just as any other Python function. Our function has one input parameter which is the NBA's player id.\n",

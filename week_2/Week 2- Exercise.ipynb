Use your team and other resources to determine how best to complete them. Make sure before you turn in your notebook that it runs without errors and the requested output is visible in the notebook. If you go through multiple steps in your code, make sure all those steps are included so that we can evaluate your work."

Requests makes it easy to do \"web scaping\" like this. The data returned from the website is JSON, but we will reading that JSON into a pandas dataframe for analysis.\n",

Once you run the code in the cell below, the function <code>get_shot_stats</code> will be available for you to use just as any other Python function. Our function has one input parameter which is the NBA's player id.\n",

    "**Assignment**: This exercise will introduce pandas and conduct a simple analysis a visualization. Specifically, your group will have to complete the following:\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Read in the described dataset\n",
    "* Produce descriptive statistics\n",
    "* Produce a basic plot\n",
    "* Provide commentary on the dataset\n",
    "* Generalize this analysis to \"big data\"\n",

    "For this exercise, you will have to complete all the tasks within this notebook, save the entire notebook, and then upload into the Week 1 Assignment for your group on BlackBoard. Save this notebook with a new name with the following format:\n",

Use your team and other resources to determine how best to complete them. Make sure before you turn in your notebook that it runs without errors and the requested output is visible in the notebook. If you go through multiple steps in your code, make sure all those steps are included so that we can evaluate your work."

    "## Read in Data From CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be using is the [classic iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) from 1936. This dataset was used by Ronald Fisher to quantify the attributes of iris flowers that grouped them into different species. This dataset is also used to provide a basic demonstration of clustering algorithms in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be reading the data into a Python data type called a [dataframe](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html).  A dataframe is a two dimensional array-like structure that is part of the pandas library. Unlike the NumPy array we used earlier, a pandas dataframe is more flexible and user friendly in that it can include multiple data types and uses a label-based naming structure for columns and rows. A pandas dataframe is similar to the [dataframe](http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/data-frame) in the statistical programming language R.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to read the iris dataset into a dataframe, we will use the general approach of:\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "dataframe_name = pd.DataFrame.from_csv('path_and_filename_of_csv_file')\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for this method is here- http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-structured dataframe generally has an index that identifies each case in our data.  A case is generally an individual line of data in a dataset which represent a discrete sample. In the pandas output, the index is the first column of data or can be accessed directly by calling <code>dataframe.index</code>. The column names are the first row in the output of can be accessed directly by calling <code>dataframe.columns</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Side Note on Attributes and Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that \"<code>dataframe.index</code>\" did not include parentheses after \"index\" given the index is an attribute (think of it like a part) of the dataframe rather than a callable method (think of it as a coded function running on the dataframe). \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes this can be a bit confusing in pandas as you might not know whether a given thing is a method which needs \"()\" after it or an attribute that does not need \"()\". For some objects, Python will let you know when something is a method.  The code below demonstrates this."

       "\n",
       "I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\n",
       "Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\n",
       "his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\n",
       "between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but\n",
       "he didn't make much headway, I thought.\n",
       "\n",
       "At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\n",
       "adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord\n",
       "said he couldn't afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each\n",
       "in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and\n",
       "hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But\n",
       "the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat and potatoes,\n",
       "but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in\n",
       "a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\n",
       "manner.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the harpooneer\n",

       "\"The devil he does,\" says I. \"Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?\"\n",

       "\n",
       "Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord\n",
       "cried, \"That's the Grampus's crew. I seed her reported in the offing\n",
       "this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now\n",
       "we'll have the latest news from the Feegees.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,\n",
       "and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy\n",
       "watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all\n",
       "bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an\n",
       "eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat,\n",
       "and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they\n",
       "made a straight wake for the whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled\n",
       "little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all\n",
       "round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah\n",
       "mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a\n",
       "sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how\n",
       "long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the\n",

       "about most obstreperously.\n",
       "\n",
       "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\n",
       "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own\n",
       "sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise\n",
       "as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods\n",
       "had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a\n",
       "sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will\n",
       "here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet\n",
       "in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have\n",
       "seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,\n",
       "making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep\n",
       "shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give\n",
       "him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner,\n",
       "and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall\n",
       "mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry\n",
       "of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away\n",
       "unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the\n",
       "sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and\n",
       "being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised\n",
       "a cry of \"Bulkington! Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of\n",
       "the house in pursuit of him.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\n",
       "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\n",
       "upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance\n",
       "of the seamen.\n",
       "\n",
       "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\n",
       "rather not sleep with your own brother. I don't know how it is, but\n",
       "people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\n",
       "sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\n",
       "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\n",
       "multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\n",
       "sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\n",
       "two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they\n",
       "all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\n",
       "cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\n",
       "\n",
       "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\n",
       "thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\n",
       "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\n",
       "the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\n",
       "Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be\n",
       "home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\n",
       "midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Landlord! I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't sleep\n",
       "with him. I'll try the bench here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I can't spare ye a tablecloth for a\n",
       "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots and\n",
       "notches. \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's plane\n",
       "there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\" So saying\n",
       "he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\n",
       "the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\n",
       "like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\n",
       "plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\n",
       "near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's sake to quit--the\n",
       "bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\n",
       "in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\n",
       "shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\n",
       "the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\n",
       "brown study.\n",
       "\n",
       "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\n",
       "short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\n",
       "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\n",
       "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\n",
       "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\n",
       "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\n",
       "soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under\n",
       "the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially\n",
       "as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window,\n",
       "and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate\n",
       "vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.\n",
       "\n",
       "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I steal\n",
       "a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\n",
       "wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\n",
       "second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\n",
       "morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\n",
       "standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending\n",
       "a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I began to think\n",
       "that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against\n",
       "this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must be dropping\n",
       "in before long. I'll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may\n",
       "become jolly good bedfellows after all--there's no telling.\n",
       "\n",
       "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\n",
       "and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Landlord!\" said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep such\n",
       "late hours?\" It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.\n",
       "\n",
       "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to\n",
       "be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. \"No,\" he\n",
       "answered, \"generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to\n",
       "rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\n",
       "a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him so late,\n",
       "unless, may be, he can't sell his head.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you\n",
       "are telling me?\" getting into a towering rage. \"Do you pretend to say,\n",
       "landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday\n",
       "night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn't\n",
       "sell it here, the market's overstocked.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With what?\" shouted I.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you'd better\n",
       "stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"May be not,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I\n",
       "rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a\n",
       "slanderin' his head.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'll break it for him,\" said I, now flying into a passion again at this\n",
       "unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's broke a'ready,\" said he.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Broke,\" said I--\"BROKE, do you mean?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Landlord,\" said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\n",
       "snow-storm--\"landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\n",
       "another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\n",
       "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\n",
       "belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I\n",
       "have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\n",
       "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\n",
       "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of connexion,\n",
       "landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\n",
       "degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\n",
       "harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\n",
       "night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\n",
       "that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\n",
       "evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping\n",
       "with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean, landlord, YOU, sir, by trying\n",
       "to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to\n",
       "a criminal prosecution.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that's a purty long\n",
       "sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,\n",
       "this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just arrived from\n",
       "the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads\n",
       "(great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but one, and that one\n",
       "he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, and it would not\n",
       "do to be sellin' human heads about the streets when folks is goin' to\n",
       "churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was\n",
       "goin' out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the\n",
       "airth like a string of inions.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\n",
       "that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me--but at\n",
       "the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\n",
       "Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\n",
       "business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He pays reg'lar,\" was the rejoinder. \"But come, it's getting dreadful\n",
       "late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed; Sal and me\n",
       "slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There's plenty of room\n",
       "for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big bed that. Why,\n",
       "afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the\n",
       "foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and\n",
       "somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\n",
       "Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, I'll give ye a\n",
       "glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\n",
       "me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\n",
       "clock in the corner, he exclaimed \"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that\n",
       "harpooneer to-night; he's come to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO\n",
       "come; WON'T ye come?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\n",
       "ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\n",
       "with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers\n",
       "to sleep abreast.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\n",
       "that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there, make\n",
       "yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\" I turned round from\n",
       "eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
       "\n",
       "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the\n",
       "most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced\n",
       "round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see\n",
       "no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four\n",
       "walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of\n",
       "things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed\n",
       "up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman's bag,\n",
       "containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.\n",
       "Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf\n",
       "over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\n",
       "\n",
       "But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\n",
       "light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive\n",
       "at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to\n",
       "nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\n",
       "tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\n",
       "Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat,\n",
       "as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\n",
       "that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\n",
       "streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try\n",
       "it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and\n",
       "thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer\n",
       "had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass\n",
       "stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore\n",
       "myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\n",
       "\n",
       "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
       "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\n",
       "the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\n",
       "the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought\n",
       "a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\n",
       "half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\n",
       "the harpooneer's not coming home at all that night, it being so very\n",
       "late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and\n",
       "then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the\n",
       "care of heaven.\n",
       "\n",
       "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\n",
       "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep\n",
       "for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty\n",
       "nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy\n",
       "footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room\n",
       "from under the door.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
       "head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\n",
       "till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\n",
       "Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\n",
       "looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the\n",
       "floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords\n",
       "of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all\n",
       "eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while\n",
       "employed in unlacing the bag's mouth. This accomplished, however, he\n",
       "turned round--when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of\n",
       "a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large\n",
       "blackish looking squares. Yes, it's just as I thought, he's a terrible\n",
       "bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is,\n",
       "just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face\n",
       "so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\n",
       "sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\n",
       "stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\n",
       "but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of\n",
       "a white man--a whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been\n",
       "tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his\n",
       "distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it,\n",
       "thought I, after all! It's only his outside; a man can be honest in any\n",
       "sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that\n",
       "part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the\n",
       "squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of\n",
       "tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man\n",
       "into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas;\n",
       "and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the\n",
       "skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning,\n",
       "this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty\n",
       "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled\n",
       "out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing\n",
       "these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New\n",
       "Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed it down into the bag.\n",
       "He now took off his hat--a new beaver hat--when I came nigh singing out\n",
       "with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at\n",
       "least--nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His\n",
       "bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.\n",
       "Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted\n",
       "out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.\n",
       "\n",
       "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\n",
       "it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of\n",
       "this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\n",
       "Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\n",
       "confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him\n",
       "as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\n",
       "the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not\n",
       "game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\n",
       "concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\n",
       "his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered\n",
       "with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same\n",
       "dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' War, and just\n",
       "escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very\n",
       "legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up\n",
       "the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some\n",
       "abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South\n",
       "Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it.\n",
       "A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might\n",
       "take a fancy to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n",
       "\n",
       "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n",
       "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that\n",
       "he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or\n",
       "dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the\n",
       "pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with\n",
       "a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days' old Congo\n",
       "baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that\n",
       "this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But\n",
       "seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal\n",
       "like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden\n",
       "idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the\n",
       "empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this\n",
       "little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The\n",
       "chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I\n",
       "thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel\n",
       "for his Congo idol.\n",
       "\n",
       "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n",
       "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow. First he takes\n",
       "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\n",
       "them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\n",
       "top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\n",
       "a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire,\n",
       "and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be\n",
       "scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;\n",
       "then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of\n",
       "it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such\n",
       "dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange\n",
       "antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the\n",
       "devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some\n",
       "pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the\n",
       "most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol\n",
       "up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\n",
       "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",
       "\n",
       "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\n",
       "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\n",
       "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\n",
       "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\n",
       "I had so long been bound.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\n",
       "Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an\n",
       "instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,\n",
       "he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light\n",
       "was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth,\n",
       "sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving\n",

       "\n",
       "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\n",
       "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\n",
       "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\n",
       "guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\n",
       "meaning.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that that\n",

       "throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil\n",
       "but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment.\n",
       "For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking\n",
       "cannibal. What's all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to\n",
       "myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown\n",
       "over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\n",
       "thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\n",
       "odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\n",
       "tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure,\n",
       "no two parts of which were of one precise shade--owing I suppose to\n",
       "his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\n",
       "sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times--this same arm of his, I\n",
       "say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt.\n",
       "Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could\n",
       "hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and\n",
       "it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that\n",
       "Queequeg was hugging me.\n",
       "\n",
       "My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\n",
       "child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\n",
       "whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.\n",
       "The circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other--I\n",
       "think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\n",
       "sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\n",
       "was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,--my\n",
       "mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\n",
       "bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\n",
       "the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\n",
       "there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\n",
       "third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\n",
       "and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\n",
       "\n",
       "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\n",
       "before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the\n",
       "small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the\n",
       "sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\n",
       "streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\n",
       "and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\n",
       "stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself\n",
       "at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\n",
       "slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie\n",
       "abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most\n",
       "conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\n",
       "several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I\n",
       "have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At\n",
       "last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly\n",
       "waking from it--half steeped in dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before\n",
       "sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock\n",
       "running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was\n",
       "to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung\n",
       "over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form\n",
       "or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my\n",
       "bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with\n",
       "the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking\n",
       "that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\n",
       "broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me;\n",
       "but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for\n",
       "days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\n",
       "attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle\n",
       "myself with it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n",
       "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\n",
       "those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan\n",
       "arm thrown round me. But at length all the past night's events soberly\n",
       "recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\n",
       "the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm--unlock his\n",
       "bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\n",
       "as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\n",
       "him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over,\n",
       "my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\n",
       "slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\n",
       "sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\n",
       "pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\n",
       "broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \"Queequeg!--in the name of\n",
       "goodness, Queequeg, wake!\" At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\n",
       "loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\n",
       "hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\n",
       "extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\n",
       "all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed,\n",
       "stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he\n",
       "did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\n",
       "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\n",
       "him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\n",
       "now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\n",
       "last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\n",
       "and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\n",
       "the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\n",
       "if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\n",
       "afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\n",
       "under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\n",
       "truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what\n",
       "you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\n",
       "particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\n",
       "civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\n",
       "staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\n",
       "the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\n",
       "a man like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well\n",
       "worth unusual regarding.\n",
       "\n",
       "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,\n",
       "by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his boots.\n",
       "What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next\n",
       "movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed;\n",
       "when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was\n",
       "hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever\n",
       "heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\n",
       "boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\n",
       "stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\n",
       "to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\n",
       "education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\n",
       "been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\n",
       "himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\n",
       "he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\n",
       "last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his\n",
       "eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\n",
       "being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\n",
       "ones--probably not made to order either--rather pinched and tormented\n",
       "him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\n",
       "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\n",
       "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\n",
       "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\n",
       "I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat,\n",
       "and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\n",
       "complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\n",
       "morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to\n",
       "my amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\n",
       "chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\n",
       "piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\n",
       "and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\n",
       "his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner,\n",
       "slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little\n",
       "on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall,\n",
       "begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks\n",
       "I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance.\n",
       "Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of\n",
       "what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp\n",
       "the long straight edges are always kept.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\n",

       "it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the\n",

       "floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel's\n",
       "face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\n",

       "his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost\n",

       "seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost\n",
       "in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\n",
       "snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of\n",
       "being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the\n",
       "boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\n",
       "midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and\n",
       "crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one\n",
       "end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it\n",
       "round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar\n",
       "was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the\n",
       "wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg,\n",
       "stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of\n",
       "a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,\n",
       "throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing\n",
       "his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand\n",
       "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone\n",
       "down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now\n",
       "took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters\n",
       "were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again,\n",
       "one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form.\n",
       "The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands\n",
       "voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that\n",

       "belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island\n",
       "of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will\n",

       "Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\n",
       "settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle\n",
       "swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant\n",
       "Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne\n",
       "out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same\n",

       "\n",
       "What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take\n",

       "experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\n",

       "put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in\n",
       "at Behring's Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared\n",

       "cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as\n",

       "In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and\n",
       "no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\n",
       "diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little god--and Yojo\n",
       "had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\n",
       "everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\n",
       "harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo\n",
       "earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly\n",
       "with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to\n",
       "do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I,\n",
       "Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it\n",
       "had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\n",
       "myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\n",
       "confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising forecast\n",
       "of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good\n",
       "sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all\n",
       "cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the selection\n",
       "of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied\n",
       "upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry\n",
       "us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced\n",
       "no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly\n",
       "prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort\n",
       "of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little\n",
       "affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our\n",
       "little bedroom--for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan,\n",
       "or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that\n",
       "day; HOW it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself\n",
       "to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX\n",
       "Articles--leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo\n",
       "warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among\n",
       "the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries,\n",
       "I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The\n",
       "Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. DEVIL-DAM, I do not know the\n",
       "origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt remember, was\n",
       "the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct\n",
       "as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her,\n",
       "hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod,\n",
       "looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very\n",
       "ship for us.\n",
       "\n",
       "You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\n",
       "know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\n",
       "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\n",
       "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old\n",
       "school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look\n",
       "about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms\n",
       "of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was darkened like a French\n",
       "grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable\n",
       "bows looked bearded. Her masts--cut somewhere on the coast of Japan,\n",
       "where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale--her masts stood\n",
       "stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her\n",
       "ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\n",
       "flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\n",
       "her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\n",
       "to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed.\n",
       "Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded\n",
       "another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the\n",
       "principal owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his\n",

       "it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched\n",
       "by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or bedstead. She\n",
       "was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with\n",
       "pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of\n",
       "a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All\n",
       "round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous\n",
       "jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for\n",
       "pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not\n",
       "through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of\n",
       "sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported\n",
       "there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved\n",
       "from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who\n",
       "steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds\n",
       "back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a\n",

       "\n",
       "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,\n",
       "in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw\n",
       "nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or\n",
       "rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only\n",
       "a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten\n",
       "feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken\n",
       "from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale.\n",
       "Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced\n",
       "together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in\n",
       "a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the\n",
       "top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem's head. A triangular opening\n",
       "faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a\n",
       "complete view forward.\n",
       "\n",
       "And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who\n",
       "by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\n",
       "the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\n",
       "command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\n",
       "over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\n",
       "stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\n",
       "constructed.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\n",
       "the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\n",
       "and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\n",
       "only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\n",
       "wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from\n",
       "his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\n",

       "Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\n",
       "ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\n",

       "exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\n",
       "could see.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, what's the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon though,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\n",

       "\n",
       "\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come\n",
       "along with ye.\" And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\n",
       "surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\n",
       "Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\n",
       "shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\n",
       "of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each\n",
       "owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail\n",
       "or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling\n",
       "vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks\n",
       "bringing in good interest.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\n",
       "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\n",
       "this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\n",
       "peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified\n",
       "by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\n",
       "Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\n",
       "are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\n",
       "\n",
       "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture\n",
       "names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in childhood\n",
       "naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker\n",
       "idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure\n",
       "of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown\n",
       "peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a\n",
       "Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things\n",
       "unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain\n",
       "and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion\n",
       "of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath\n",
       "constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\n",
       "untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature's sweet or\n",
       "savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\n",
       "breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\n",
       "advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language--that man makes\n",
       "one in a whole nation's census--a mighty pageant creature, formed for\n",
       "noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically\n",
       "regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems\n",
       "a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all\n",
       "men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure\n",
       "of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But,\n",
       "as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and\n",
       "still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another\n",
       "phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n",
       "\n",
       "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\n",
       "But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what are called\n",
       "serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\n",
       "veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been originally\n",
       "educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all\n",
       "his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island\n",
       "creatures, round the Horn--all that had not moved this native born\n",
       "Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his\n",
       "vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of\n",
       "common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg. Though refusing, from\n",
       "conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\n",
       "had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe\n",
       "to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns\n",
       "upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his\n",
       "days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\n",
       "not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\n",
       "he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's\n",
       "religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This\n",
       "world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes\n",
       "of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat;\n",
       "from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a\n",
       "ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous\n",
       "career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of\n",
       "sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his\n",
       "well-earned income.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\n",

       "task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\n",
       "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\n",
       "upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore\n",
       "exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was\n",

       "or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other,\n",
       "never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own\n",
       "person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his\n",

       "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\n",
       "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\n",
       "was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\n",
       "and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\n",
       "placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\n",
       "buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\n",
       "reading from a ponderous volume.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\n",
       "studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain\n",
       "knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\n",
       "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and\n",
       "seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\n",
       "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\n",
       "\n",
       "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\n",
       "his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\n",
       "nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\n",
       "and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him,\n",
       "and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\n",
       "to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the\n",
       "voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no\n",
       "wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of\n",
       "the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the\n",
       "degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's\n",
       "company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own\n",
       "lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea,\n",
       "could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that\n",
       "from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that\n",
       "is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever\n",
       "that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they\n",
       "call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a\n",
       "lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out\n",
       "on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would\n",
       "not have to pay one stiver.\n",
       "\n",
       "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\n",
       "fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\n",
       "that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\n",
       "world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim\n",
       "sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay\n",
       "would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I\n",
       "been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\n",
       "\n",
       "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\n",
       "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\n",
       "something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\n",
       "how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\n",
       "the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\n",
       "whole management of the ship's affairs to these two. And I did not know\n",
       "but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\n",
       "shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\n",
       "quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\n",
       "own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\n",
       "jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was\n",
       "such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\n",
       "us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, \"LAY not up for\n",
       "yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what lay\n",
       "shall we give this young man?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\n",
       "seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust do\n",
       "corrupt, but LAY--'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\n",
       "seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\n",
       "shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.\n",
       "It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though from the\n",
       "magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\n",
       "the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\n",
       "seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make\n",
       "a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\n",
       "seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\n",
       "hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\n",
       "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without lifting\n",
       "his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure is, there\n",
       "will your heart be also.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do ye\n",
       "hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n",
       "\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\n",
       "duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and orphans,\n",
       "many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\n",
       "young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\n",
       "orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\n",
       "cabin. \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\n",
       "matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\n",
       "heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape\n",
       "Horn.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing\n",
       "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art still\n",
       "an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be\n",
       "but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the\n",
       "fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\n",
       "insult me. It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\n",
       "he's bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and\n",
       "start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a live goat with\n",
       "all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured\n",
       "son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous\n",
       "oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\n",
       "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\n",
       "all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\n",
       "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\n",
       "I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\n",
       "wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\n",
       "transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\n",
       "withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\n",
       "for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\n",
       "left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\n",
       "little as if still nervously agitated. \"Whew!\" he whistled at last--\"the\n",
       "squall's gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at\n",
       "sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs\n",
       "the grindstone. That's he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,\n",
       "Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,\n",
       "for the three hundredth lay.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\n",
       "too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To be sure,\" said Peleg. \"Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in\n",
       "which he had again been burying himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg. \"Has he ever\n",
       "whaled it any?\" turning to me.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, bring him along then.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I\n",
       "had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the identical\n",
       "ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\n",
       "\n",
       "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain\n",
       "with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in\n",
       "many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all\n",
       "her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving\n",
       "to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the\n",
       "shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have\n",
       "a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble\n",
       "himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till\n",
       "all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at\n",
       "him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back\n",
       "I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It's all right enough; thou\n",
       "art shipped.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present. I don't know exactly\n",
       "what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort\n",
       "of sick, and yet he don't look so. In fact, he ain't sick; but no, he\n",
       "isn't well either. Any how, young man, he won't always see me, so I\n",
       "don't suppose he will thee. He's a queer man, Captain Ahab--so some\n",
       "think--but a good one. Oh, thou'lt like him well enough; no fear, no\n",
       "fear. He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn't speak\n",
       "much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be\n",
       "forewarned; Ahab's above the common; Ahab's been in colleges, as well as\n",
       "'mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed\n",
       "his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance!\n",
       "aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain't\n",
       "Captain Bildad; no, and he ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab\n",
       "of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\n",
       "they not lick his blood?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance in\n",
       "his eye that almost startled me. \"Look ye, lad; never say that on board\n",
       "the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.\n",
       "'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died\n",
       "when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at\n",
       "Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps,\n",
       "other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It's a\n",
       "lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I've sailed with him as mate years ago;\n",
       "I know what he is--a good man--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but\n",
       "a swearing good man--something like me--only there's a good deal more of\n",
       "him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on\n",
       "the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it\n",
       "was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\n",
       "about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost\n",
       "his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of\n",
       "moody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass\n",
       "off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it's\n",
       "better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So\n",
       "good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens to\n",
       "have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not three voyages\n",
       "wedded--a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that\n",

       "incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\n",
       "wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,\n",
       "I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don't know what,\n",
       "unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange\n",
       "awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was\n",
       "not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did\n",

       "round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into\n",
       "the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought\n",
       "of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that uneasy position,\n",
       "stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched. Think of\n",
       "it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his\n",

       "\n",
       "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\n",
       "day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\n",

       "sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints,\n",

       "and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\n",
       "religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\n",
       "Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in\n",
       "cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless\n",
       "for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and\n",

       "extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained\n",
       "me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan\n",
       "of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the\n",
       "spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be\n",
       "half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish\n",
       "such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg,\n",

       "apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary\n",
       "dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n",
       "\n",

       "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\n",
       "in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\n",
       "feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\n",
       "wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the\n",
       "afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew the\n",
       "inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had\n",
       "visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when\n",
       "a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the\n",
       "yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed\n",
       "in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with\n",
       "breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were\n",
       "sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends, just as\n",
       "though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\n",
       "\n",
       "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",
       "impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed\n",
       "dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his\n",
       "own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one\n",
       "third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he\n",
       "no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than\n",
       "I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and\n",
       "compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible\n",
       "young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.\n",
       "\n",

       "overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and\n",
       "endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his\n",
       "life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that\n",
       "sort of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to\n",
       "spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward portents\n",
       "and inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent the\n",
       "welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories\n",
       "of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the\n",

       "of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous\n",

       "it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\n",

       "a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,\n",
       "forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his\n",

       "and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful,\n",
       "consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that,\n",

       "standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\n",
       "heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\n",
       "grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as\n",
       "if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\n",
       "bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\n",
       "came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\n",
       "for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck,\n",
       "he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was\n",
       "only making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\n",
       "preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\n",
       "that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\n",

       "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\n",

       "the fright. 'What am I about?' says I at last. 'And what business is\n",

       "'wise Stubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of\n",
       "his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying\n",
       "over his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I might as well fall to\n",

       "\n",
       "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\n",
       "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it\n",
       "still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\n",
       "Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate the whales from\n",
       "the fish.\" But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,\n",
       "sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's express edict,\n",
       "were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the\n",
       "Leviathan.\n",
       "\n",
       "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from\n",
       "the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm bilocular\n",
       "heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\n",
       "intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex lege naturae jure\n",
       "meritoque.\" I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\n",
       "Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and\n",
       "they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\n",
       "insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\n",
       "\n",
       "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\n",
       "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\n",
       "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\n",
       "respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given\n",
       "you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;\n",
       "whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n",
       "\n",
       "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\n",
       "conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\n",
       "whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL. There you have\n",
       "him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\n",
       "meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\n",
       "fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\n",
       "still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\n",
       "noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\n",
       "vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\n",
       "though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\n",
       "position.\n",
       "\n",
       "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\n",
       "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\n",
       "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\n",
       "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.*\n",
       "Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be\n",
       "included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand\n",
       "divisions of the entire whale host.\n",

       "\n",
       "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place\n",
       "as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising\n",

       "\n",
       "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced\n",
       "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\n",
       "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\n",
       "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\n",
       "officer called the Specksynder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\n",

       "those days, the captain's authority was restricted to the navigation\n",
       "and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\n",
       "department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer\n",
       "reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\n",
       "title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\n",
       "his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply\n",
       "as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain's more\n",
       "inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\n",
       "harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\n",
       "in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat,\n",
       "but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the\n",
       "command of the ship's deck is also his; therefore the grand political\n",
       "maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from\n",
       "the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\n",
       "professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\n",

       "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\n",

       "\n",
       "When the last echo of his sultan's step has died away, and Starbuck, the\n",
       "first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck\n",
       "rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after\n",
       "a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,\n",
       "\"Dinner, Mr. Stubb,\" and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges\n",

       "takes up the old burden, and with a rapid \"Dinner, Mr. Flask,\" follows\n",
       "after his predecessors.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\n",
       "seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\n",

       "motioned Starbuck's plate towards him, the mate received his meat as\n",
       "though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started\n",
       "if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed it\n",
       "noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\n",
       "the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly\n",
       "dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals were\n",
       "somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab\n",
       "forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief it was\n",
       "to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. And\n",
       "poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary\n",
       "family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\n",
       "been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this\n",
       "must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had\n",
       "he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have\n",
       "been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,\n",
       "strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself,\n",
       "the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did\n",
       "Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners\n",
       "of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear,\n",
       "sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such\n",
       "marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for\n",
       "him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\n",
       "\n",
       "Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\n",
       "is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask's dinner was badly\n",
       "jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;\n",
       "and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb\n",
       "even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small\n",
       "appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask\n",
       "must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day;\n",
       "for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck.\n",
       "Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since he\n",
       "had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never\n",
       "known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what\n",
       "he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.\n",
       "Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from\n",

       "old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the\n",
       "mast. There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:\n",
       "there's the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere\n",
       "sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official\n",

       "\n",
       "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\n",
       "in the Pequod's cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\n",
       "order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\n",
       "restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three\n",
       "harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees.\n",
       "They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of the high and mighty\n",

       "\n",
       "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\n",
       "invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire care-free\n",
       "license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows\n",
       "the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the\n",
       "sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food\n",
       "with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;\n",
       "they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.\n",
       "Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out\n",
       "the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was\n",
       "fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of\n",
       "the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with\n",
       "a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\n",
       "accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once\n",
       "Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory by\n",
       "snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\n",
       "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\n",
       "circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous,\n",
       "shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny\n",
       "of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing\n",
       "spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous\n",
       "visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life was one\n",
       "continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished\n",
       "with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into\n",
       "his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the\n",
       "blinds of its door, till all was over.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\n",
       "his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the\n",
       "floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low\n",
       "carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin\n",
       "framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a\n",
       "ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\n",
       "not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\n",
       "small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,\n",
       "baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed\n",
       "strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his\n",
       "dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\n",
       "beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\n",
       "mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so\n",
       "much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether\n",
       "any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\n",
       "Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be\n",
       "picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging\n",
       "round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the\n",
       "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\n",
       "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\n",
       "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at\n",
       "all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his\n",
       "Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some\n",
       "murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the\n",
       "white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on\n",
       "his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight,\n",
       "the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous,\n",
       "fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every\n",
       "step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\n",
       "\n",
       "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\n",
       "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\n",
       "scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,\n",
       "when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.\n",

       "the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to\n",
       "have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it\n",
       "was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for\n",
       "a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\n",
       "residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\n",
       "was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\n",
       "included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He\n",
       "lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\n",
       "Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of\n",
       "the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter\n",
       "there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age,\n",

       "archaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical\n",
       "purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like\n",
       "formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious\n",
       "long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount\n",
       "to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a\n",

       "though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely\n",
       "incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange\n",

       "his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars,\n",

       "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\n",

       "that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\n",

       "who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh\n",
       "the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the\n",
       "one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads\n",
       "are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their\n",
       "regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two\n",
       "hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant\n",
       "the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There\n",

       "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\n",
       "as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,\n",
       "that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\n",
       "bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\n",
       "seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has\n",

       "the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said\n",
       "to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface);\n",

       "Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land\n",

       "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing\n",
       "that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped\n",
       "alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should\n",
       "go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only\n",
       "ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that\n",
       "though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still\n",
       "swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick\n",

       "\n",
       "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with\n",

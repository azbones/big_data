    "  \n",
    "* Use the <code>read_gbq</code> to retrieve data from the GSOD dataset\n",
    "* Use pandas to describe the data\n",
    "* Use SQL to return summarized data to pandas from BigQuery\n",
    "* Use <code>pivot_table</code> to display the data by month and year\n",
    "* Compare and contrast PaaS versus build it yourself analytics solutions\n",
    "* Discuss approaches to optimizing aggregation performance in a PaaS workflow\n",

Use your team and other resources to determine how best to complete them. Make sure before you turn in your notebook that it runs without errors and the requested output is visible in the notebook. If you go through multiple steps in your code, make sure all those steps are included so that we can evaluate your work."

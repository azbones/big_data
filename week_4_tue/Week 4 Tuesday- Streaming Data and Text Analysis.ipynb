    "  \n",
    "* Streaming Data\n",
    "* Build code to connect to the Twitter streaming API\n",

    "## Streaming Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming data often embodies all three of the traditional \"big data\" V's- variety, velocity, and volume. Much, but not all, of this data is also unstructured. In this context, we are discussing streaming data and not streaming media like video or audio although streaming media is also a component of \"big data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For analytics and streaming data, a typical use case might look like the following example from Amazon Web Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azbones/big_data/master/images/Kinesis-Streams_Diagram.png\">\n",
    "(source: https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/)\n",
    "\n",
    "A streaming analytics pipeline can be used for many applications including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* real-time machine learning (recommendations, predictions, etc.)\n",
    "* real-time analytics\n",
    "* distributed data generation and collection (JSON activity streams and xAPI)\n",
    "* Internet of Things data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Open source platforms used to handle and analyze streaming data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apache Kafka for messaging- http://kafka.apache.org/\n",
    "* Apache Storm for real-time computation- http://storm.apache.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced firms like Palantir are expanding beyond the traditional single stream applications like recommendation to have a system built on analyzing and integrating multiple, disparate data streams as can be seen in these product descriptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* https://www.palantir.com/solutions/insider-threat/\n",
    "* https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial firms are also using Twitter data directly or from aggregators like RavenPack to either inform or in some cases trigger trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "* http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-04-24/how-many-hft-firms-actually-use-twitter-to-trade\n",
    "* http://www.ravenpack.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "A key tool in the example of financial trading is sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing and text processing to infer attitudes about the subject of that text. In simplistic financial terms, if the public has positive attitudes about a given firm or its stock, these attitudes will be correlated with price stability or increases in value. Recent examples have even included April Fools Twitter jokes that have seemed to impact stock prices:\n",

    "* http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/01/tesla-stock-moves-on-april-fools-joke/\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time analysis of the text data associated with these streams was likely involved in trading decisions like this. More broadly, the use of text analysis and streaming data can be a critical component of any firm's analytics efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to get experience with Twitter's streaming API and basic text analysis of that streaming data."

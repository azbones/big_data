    "**Learning Assumptions and Data Lab Objectives**:  The lab objective is to help you gain a conceptual understanding of the process and technologies that are used in data science and \"big data\" via hands-on activities. Many of these activities are common tasks for data scientists. This high-level perspective will help you understand how data science and \"big data\" fits into the larger context of information technology and systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given these lab exercises are done in groups, you should take advantage of the team's collective knowledge to discuss concepts that you find difficult in order to build your own understanding. Each assignment **should be done as a group** to give everyone the opportunity to participate. Use the pair programming technique where you switch off between those that are writing the code (drivers) or responses and the rest of the group that is developing the plan (navigators). All of us are responsible for creating a productive learning environment for the entire class, so please contribute to making the environment positive and productive for everyone. We will follow the Python code of conduct- https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises should be able to be completed in class, so ask if something isn't clear. If your technical and analytical expertise is beyond the basic level of these exercises, take on the role of adviser and help bring others up to speed and extend your work to add more sophistication or functionality.\n",
    "      \n",
    "**This Week's Objectives**: Today we are going to get your development environments set up, introduce you to the various tools and resources we will be using in class, and conduct your first analysis. This will include:\n",

    "* Setting up your environment with Anacoda which is the free Python distribution for data science we will be using\n",
    "* Reviewing how to install these Jupyter notebooks on the PC your team will be using \n",
    "* Where to learn more or get help\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first start the class, you will most likely be viewing a static version of this page on GitHub. Once you follow the directions below, you will have Python and our required libraries running on your computer.  You can download the \"live\" versions of this page which will allow you to run code and complete your assignment for the week which we detail below.\n",

    "We are using Jupyter notebooks (http://jupyter.org/) to facilitate the technical portion of our class. Jupyter notebooks offer us a web-based, interactive Python environment were we can run code, present visualizations, and provide explanatory text. We developed the notebooks for this class using the version control system Git (https://git-scm.com/) and store them centrally at GitHub (http://github.com). The notebooks are publicly **viewable** in our repository at https://github.com/azbones/big_data.  In order to run our sample code, build your own code for the assignments, answer questions in the notebook, and ultimately turn in your assignment, you will need to download the notebooks to your computer and install them. There are two ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Easy Way**: click on the \"download zip\" button, download the zip file, and then unzip in the directory where you will be doing your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **More Elite Way**: install Git on your computer and clone the GitHub directory to the directory where you will be doing your work. A review of Git is beyond the scope of this class, but you can learn more about it and GitHub here- https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/ By the way, as we consider out notebooks open source, you can actually contribute to making them better by starting a pull request which we will evaluate and perhaps include in the source code going forward. Learn about pull requests here- https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take the easy way, you may need to update your notebooks if we make changes to the notebooks during the class (which is likely).  You can always see a list of changes and their dates at https://github.com/azbones/big_data/commits/master\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take the elite way, be aware that you may need to manage how to handle any changes you want to keep in your notebooks locally with the changes we might make at the source in GitHub. This is a common issue for developers and data scientists, but is beyond the scope of our class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Running Python in the Notebooks**\n",

    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "````\n",
